# retrobuntu
Scripts and files to set up an ubuntu install for retro gaming. Tested on Ubuntu MATE 18.04, Linux Mint 19 Cinnamon. Will *probably* work on any ubuntu derivative, but I'm not guaranteeing anything.

### NOTE:

Using the scripts in this repo will add a bunch of software (including a PPA) to your system. It will overwrite config files, possibly ones that you have modified. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

### Why?

I love retro gaming but for various reasons prefer having the power of a full Ubuntu install on my retro gaming machines (over, say, Lakka). Ubuntu has great controller support, hardware support, and libretro support. It's simply the path of least resistance.

### Usage:

Clone the repo someplace, then cd into the directory and run `sudo ./install.sh`. Then go grab a beer/soda, it'll take a while. After that you should see retroarch in your start menu and on your PATH.
